Axios is a popular HTTP client library for JavaScript that simplifies making HTTP requests from both browsers and Node.js environments.

TanStack is a family of libraries, with TanStack Query being the most popular. It's a powerful data-fetching and state management library.

// Axios makes the request
const fetchUser = (id) => axios.get(`/api/users/${id}`).then(res => res.data);

// TanStack Query manages caching, refetching, and state
const { data: user } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['user', id],
  queryFn: () => fetchUser(id),
  staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // Cache for 5 minutes
});
